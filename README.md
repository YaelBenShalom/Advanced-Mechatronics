# Advanced Mechatronics

A repository for Advances Mechatronics (ME433) Homeworks

## This repository contains:

- **HW2** - Digital Signal Processing.<br>
  In this assignment I did some basic digital signal processing.<br>
  To run this assignment's code, get into the assignment's repo and run `python code/<file-name>.py --csv data/<data-name>.csv`

- **HW3** - Lab kit assembling.<br>
  In this assignment, I assembled the lab kit.

- **HW4** - Build and program a PIC circuit.<br>
  In this assignment, I built and tested the 3.3V regulator circuit, built the necessary connections for the PIC32MX170F256B, and Wrote a short program to test the PIC circuit.<br>

- **HW5** - UART to USB communication.<br>
  In this assignment, I added the Adafruit CP2104 Friend USB to UART converter to communicate with the computer.<br>

- **HW6** - Design a PCB in Eagle.<br>
  In this assignment, I built the system's circuit diagram and designed a PCB in Eagle.<br>

- **HW7** - Output waveforms using an SPI DAC.<br>
  In this assignment I used the MCP4912 to generate a 2Hz sine wave and a 1Hz triangle wave.

- **HW8** - Build the I2C IO expander.<br>
  In this assignment, I added the MCP23017 (A large DIP chip that gives you 16 more general purpose IO pins) to the board, to gain 14 controllable pins.<br>

- **HW9** - ST7789 Display.<br>
  In this assignment, I added an LCD screen (ST7789).<br>

- **HW10** - Set the color of 4 LEDs.<br>
  In this assignment, I added a little color to our circuit and used some WS2812B addressable color LEDs.<br>

- **HW11** - IMU.<br>
  In this assignment, I added an IMU to calculate acceleration (accelerometer) and angular velocity (gyroscopic) data about the X, Y, and Z axes with 16 bit resolution, with a variety of sensitivities.<br>

  - **HW16** - Tech Cup Prep.<br>
    In this assignment, I maked a bracket to hold the brushed DC gearmotor to the PCB.
